# Local-Business-Explorer

## Overview
 
This [Local Business Explorer](https://leedillon.github.io/Local-Business-Explorer) app allows the user to search for any type of business in any city. A results page then shows 10 businesses related to the users search input in the form of cards with the businesses details as well as the businesses addresses pin pointed on a map. The map and pin points where generated using api calls from [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [foursquare](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/). The user can then favourite businesses and have the favourited businesses stored in their local storage and displayed as cards on the favourites page.
